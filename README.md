# Nextflix 

A simple Netflix Clone made using [React.js](react.dev)

In this project, I have implemented the basic UI with media details fetch functionality.

I have used TMDB for fetching movie details. 

I have also Added Authentication using Google Firebase. 

Deployed it using Netlify [here](https://66369c10822f9440f21cb1fb--resplendent-narwhal-26e58c.netlify.app/).
